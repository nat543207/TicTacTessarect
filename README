TicTacTessarect
===============

A repo to hold the code for my n-dimensional tic-tac-toe game, made for my C++ independent study.  This is the last version that will be
pushed to the 'master' branch; all further development will continue in the 'added_features' branch.  As it is now, the program compiles,
but a few persistent bugs remain.  Known bugs:

1.  Program susceptible to input overflow, since I still can't figure out how to clear the cin buffer.
2.  On the 7th move of the game (2d or 4d), the program crashes trying to call delete[] on a dynamically-sized array.
3.  The method that generates combinations of numbers double-counts values in the player's move array, creating false-postitve victories 
    e. g. a player on a 3x3 board who's played at [1, 3] and [3, 2] will win becasue 3 + 6 + 6 = 15, which is the magic constant of
    a 3x3 magic square.

With the exceptions of these bugs, though, everything seems to work as it ought to.
